# ⏱️ Time Series Analysis in Python

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** focused on performing **Time Series Analysis and Forecasting** using Python.  
It demonstrates how to visualize, decompose, and forecast time-dependent data to uncover patterns such as trend, seasonality, and noise.

## 📘 Contents
- Introduction to Time Series Data  
- Data Preprocessing and Index Handling  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Time Series Decomposition (Trend, Seasonality, Residuals)  
- Stationarity Testing (ADF Test)  
- Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation (ACF & PACF)  
- Forecasting Models: AR, MA, ARIMA, SARIMA  
- Model Evaluation and Forecast Visualization

## ⚙️ Requirements
Install the required Python libraries before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn

🧩 Technologies Used
>Python 3.x
>Jupyter Notebook
>Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
>Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
>Statsmodels for statistical modeling and forecasting

📊 Visualizations
The notebook includes:
>Line plots for time trends
>Seasonal decomposition charts
>ACF & PACF correlation plots
>Forecasting and residual error plots

🔮 Forecasting Models Explained
AR (AutoRegressive):	Uses past values to predict future data points
MA (Moving Average):	Models errors as a combination of past forecast errors
ARIMA:	Combines AR and MA models for non-stationary data
SARIMA:	Extends ARIMA to include seasonality components
